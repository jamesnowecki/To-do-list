# To-do list app

One of the mentors who pushed me to learn to code suggested simulating one of our favourite 2-player abstract board games as a useful exercise in learning OOP and functional programming. It provided a brilliant platform for validating the OOP and functional programming concepts we were learning on the course as I went along and my skills improved.
